I, @KyddKarma, got the honor of bringing the new year in by interrogating @Madkol, a newer face among the virtual contributor/editorial halls. But Madkol has already made a solid case for a plaque in that hall - he's #1 on Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, and Smash Mouth, and top 5 on countless others. Not only are his Grade-A annotations noteworthy, but his character, dedication, and versatility are commendable. He bounces around from Pop to Rap to Country at all days and night."", '', ""Me and Madkol became editors around the same week, if not the same day, and my IQ seems insignificant next to his 41,314 and counting, but I'm not surprised that he got that high in so fast - as I got to know him and talk to him, I learned that he was the kind of person I expected him to be, and better. I can't think of anything negative to say about him, and anyone that's interacted with him through Genius should express the same sentiment."", '', ""The internet is a weird place. I see Genius as a sort of musical 'book club' of sorts, a very large one at that. At the time that I'm posting this, recent events involving staff members have hit all of us as an online community, and hard. Obviously, Madkol's interview was prior to this, but something he said stuck through for what was echoed by so many in the international and forum community, and it speaks directly to the leadership qualities Madkol possesses.Just keep fighting. Keep fighting the good fight. And keep annotating, getting rid of the red, and helping make Genius a better place, so do what you gotta do to do that, and be yourself.That's a pretty deep and foresightful line, even coming from a poet/writer, even to a poet/writer like me. Throughout this interview we talk about his quick acension to editorial stardom on Genius and some of his views on musical figures and events. Of course, we reflected heavily on 2016's trying events, and even the future that 2017 holds - including an event that just past by us, that foremention inauguration. We interviewed early in the week and spent the time we could transcribing the interviews from recording. So much is covered in this interview - from our shared disapproval of metal and running, to my attempted comprehension of his love for Taylor and Hopsin. I planned out a good number of questions with Madkol, and of course spontaneous ones were asked and answered with no problem at all - and after I ran out of prerequisites, me and Kol kept the interview going for 8 minutes, and it was one of the better conversations I had had in weeks. Probably the best of the new year!"", '', 'Kol is someone all of you should get to know, so I recommend all of you get through this long read. I\'m honored to be a virtual friend of his. And without further rumbling, I present to you, ""An Enlightening Madko(o)l convo with Madkol"".', '', '--', '', 'K: How are you?', ""M: I'm good! How are you doing?"", '', 'K: What has driven you on Genius, to get so much IQ in such a short time?', '', ""M: Definitely a lot of clean up. I would say I've been removing a lot of red, and deleting some of the more simple annotations that have been made years ago, that are only one or two sentences long. And Ben Carter actually made a thread about this recently, and I've really just been following that and deleting some of the older ones, which has really spiked my IQ recently."", '', ""K:  So obviously you're a big Genius fan. What do  you like to use most? What's your most used feature?"", '', ""M: Well I would say it's not necessarily one that I use, but I love the aspect of seeing the number one scholar on each artist. I just love seeing who is good at what artists, and who is ranked where. I'm really into that. I like that aspect of it. And I also like the differentiation between unreviewed and reviewed annotations, with the red like I was talking about earlier. I like as an editor, to be able to glance at that and immediately see what I need to take care of."", '', ""K: Right, right, I agree. You know it's funny because I believe we became editors around the same day or around the same time, and you're way ahead of me! I'm nowhere near close to where you are. But it's fine, you know, you're doing you're thing. You're definitely helping the community, which is great."", '', 'M: Thanks, yeah.', '', ""K: So you're at currently 33,250, and I'm at 15,000."", '', ""M: Yeah, I've just been grinding everyday!"", '', ""K: Right, right. So, outside of Genius, I know you're a poet and write a lot of rap, so tell me about what you want to do with writing as far as your career"", '', ""M: Well I would definitely like to take it into hopefully writing songs for some major rappers out there, and also just writing in general. I like to use Genius as an outlet for a lot of my writing. And also, I'd love to just write songs, because I suck at singing! But I like to write it out, so I'd love to do that eventually."", '', ""K: I'm a writer too, I understand."", '', 'M: Yeah, I just love rhyming.', 'K: Alright, back to Genius; which artist are you most proud of annotating?', '', ""M: Well I would say--she's the one I'm number one scholar on--is Taylor Swift. Because a lot of people say that it's hard to annotate pop music, which is very true, so I think that that's a big accomplishment for me, to be able to get 6,300 IQ on everything from pop music. And I think it also just sets a good example for people, that pop music can be annotated, and there's a good way that you can do that. So, I really take pride in annotating a lot of her music."", '', 'K: That’s good, I completely understand that. You’re definitely more diverse than Taylor Swift.', '', 'M: Yeah, I like to spread it out and annotate different kinds of artists. Hip Hop, R&B, Pop, everywhere.', '', 'K: Right, and I’ll admit I’m not the biggest Taylor Swift fan; I actually like a few of her songs, but I just never really got into her music...but you definitely do a lot of work that most people wouldn’t do for her songs. I’ve seen a lot of your annotations on there, and recently you’ve been doing work on “Lemonade” by Skylar Grey and I just wanted to shout you out for doing a lot of that good work.', '', 'M: Thank you.', '', 'K: So, what would you say is the biggest parallel for you between Genius and real life?', '', 'M: Well, in a few days, it will be college; I’m starting on the 22nd, so that will definitely be a huge thing…', '', 'K: Is this going to be your first semester?', '', 'M: Yeah, I’ll actually be a freshman in college.', '', 'K: Wow, congratulations.', '', 'M: So I’ll have to divide up my time between that and Genius.', '', 'K: Where are you going?', 'M: I’m going to a Community College called Miracosta, right in Oceanside, it’s less than a mile away.', '', 'K: Well, do you know what you’re going to study, or what you’re trying to obtain?', '', 'M: I definitely want to get into writing - I’m not quite sure what yet, but I know I want to do something in that aspect.', '', 'K: That’s good! So there’s definitely going to be...you’re gonna be able to go to school and come home and work on the same things, so that’s kinda good.', '', 'What user or users would you like to meet in real life?', '', 'M: Well, there’s a couple - the one that mentored and actually made me editor, @Wandāwaisu. He’s helped me out on a ton of my annotations. He’s really friendly and helpful, and I would definitely like to meet him. Also, @GeorgePlant. He’s big in the country aspect of Genius. He totally represents country, and we’ve been working on a Genius list of ‘Funniest Country Songs’ right now.', '', 'K: I saw that! Okay.', '', 'M: He’s really friendly, and I would like to meet both of them.', '', 'K: Not bad, not bad. Has there been any users that you’ve ever...thought about? Like, what do you think when you see certain [usernames]...do you imagine what they go through at home or…?', '', 'M: I don’t know if I necessarily imagine what they’re go through at home, but I kind of imagine them listening to their favorite artist or when a song comes on, “oh, that’s good”, something like that, I kind of envision the type of music they listen to based on what I read on their pages.', '', 'K: Right, alright. I’ve heard you say - well, I’ve read you said before -  “I am my own center of my own universe in my own world where I rock to the beat of my own.” Would you like to describe what that means, for people that don’t know?', '', 'M: Sure! Basically, I just do me, and I don’t let people try to alter me to make me better, because I feel I should stick to myself and how I am, and I’ve never really been the type to worry about what people think of me.', '', 'K: Good.', '', 'M: So it doesn’t sound as narcissistic as it might, but it’s basically just [that] I like to be myself.', '', 'K: Okay, actually, the user @Anak wanted to know, “Ask him whether he’s an unstoppable force or an immovable object,” so…', '', 'M: Ooh! That’s a good one. Let’s see...I would say, probably an unstoppable force because I’m all about action, I like to propel myself forward rather than do what I’m doing in the same area, I like to explore all different aspects and try to dive into things, so I would say unstoppable force.', '', 'K: Yes, that’s exactly what I bet! When he asked, I was like,  “He’s probably going to say ‘unstoppable force,’ so I was right.', 'So, what song or album are you replaying the most often right now?', '', 'M: There’s definitely one of the biggest hits of the summer, “Closer” by the Chainsmokers.', '', 'K: Ah, yes, yes.', '', 'M: It’s been floating around the top pages on Genius for a while, that’s just like, my jam. I have that one on replay on my phone all the time.', '', 'K: So that’s your go-to song when you need to start hearing something?', '', 'M: Yeah, like if I need to get up and start dancing, I put that on.', '', 'K: I’m sure there’s a lot of music you listen to, but which genres don’t you listen to?', '', ""M: Oh, you know, metal. Like that death metal stuff, I don't really like that. When I hear all that screaming, I just start feeling sweaty and stressed out. I don't like that!"", '', 'K: I’m 100% with you on that. That’s the only genre really [I don’t like]...and you know, the funny thing is, I listen to bands like KISS that are considered metal and I’m just like...cause metal to me is like Disturbed and Mindless Self Indulgence, and just...throwing things.', '', 'M: Yeah, I’m glad I have somebody that’s with me on that, and I don’t really think of Kiss as metal.', '', 'K: Exactly!', '', 'M: You know, I think of metal as being that unintelligible growling.', '', 'K: Right, we grew up with, y’know, Disturbed...System of a Down, just...those kind of things.', '', 'Describe how Taylor Swift and her music has influenced your life. Are you a follower of her personal life or do you have little interest in that?', '', 'M: Well, I think she’s influenced my life, because she’s helped me to focus not just on rap music, the primary genre that I listen to, but also to expand my interests and listen to songs that talk about, break ups and love songs...cause y’know, I’m a love song guy, I like love songs too. And also, her voice is so pure and it accentuates what she’s feeling and I feel like, when I’m listening to her, I’m listening to an artist that’s really meaning what she’s saying.', '', 'K: We’re going to switch to rap a little bit...Tell me about your indulgence in Hopsin. A lot of people assume about Hopsin before listening to him, so how do you sell or explain the kind of artist Hopsin is to others?', '', 'M: Well, he’s definitely not for everybody, but I would say, some of the reasons I like listening to him is because he’s unique and he doesn’t rap about all the same things that other rappers do. First of all, he’s not an advocate for drugs. He’s against drugs, he even has a song [about] that: “Ill Mind Of Hopsin 6.” About his friend that OD’d on meth -', '', 'K: Oh wow…', '', 'M: Yeah, it’s pretty intense, you should listen to it. And also, he just spits fire, man, and some of his rhymes are just insane. And it might not be filled with metaphors like Lil’ Wayne or Eminem, but he says what he means, and I like that raw, personal aspect of it.', '', 'K: Is there like, one line or one thing that Hopsin has said that’s a motto for you, that represents you or him in a way?', '', ""M: Yeah, he has one line in a song - I can’t think of the name of the song right now - but it’s talking about, “Everybody's minds are stuck inside their iPhones”...and you know, I love my phone, I carry my phone everywhere, but I also think it’s important to have balance in life, and not be so focused on your phone, but interact with other people too and have a life outside of that, so that’s one of my big lines that I like from him."", '', 'K: I’m gonna talk about the two facts that I read from your biography on your Genius page…', '', 'Tell me why you hate running so much.', '', 'M: Side stitches. Yeah, if I run for a long time, I just get these horrible pains in my sides…', '', 'K: Ohhh, okay, well…', '', 'M: I’ve always found it kind of boring, like, I’d rather go sit and watch TV or something...at the risk of sounding lazy.', '', 'K: Well, at least your reason isn’t just because you’re lazy, but, I just never thought - I’m pretty fast, but I never thought about running track or anything because…what am I running for? What’s the point?', '', 'M: I feel you on that, I agree.', '', 'K: So, the other fact: How long have you been playing ping pong? How excellent are you? ‘Cause I’ve seen the video, and you seem pretty excellent.', '', 'M: Oh gosh, thank you. I’ve been playing ping pong for a long time. Probably since I was 8 or 9, so 10 or 11 years, and I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most perfect, I would probably rank myself a 7, 7 ½.', '', 'K: Really?', '', 'M: Yeah, you know, not like Olympic style, but I consider myself pretty good.', '', 'K: I think 2016 was really tough on all of us, a lot happened - one way or another, like every year - but what did you take away from the entire year and all of the events that happened?', '', 'M: Well, I just really learned to appreciate things while they last, especially people. There were a lot of huge stars that died - Prince, George Michael, just so many, and also with Trump being elected, obviously things can take a turn sometimes, and I’ve learned not to take people for granted and just, make the most out of every moment…', '', 'K: The Warriors blowing the 3-1 lead. I mean...', '', 'M: Yeah, that too!', '', 'K: There were a lot of out-of-nowhere events - is there one, either personal or even just in general, that stuck out for you? Positive, negative, just the one event that defined the year?', '', 'M: Yeah, obviously Trump being elected was a huge one, and that wasn’t so much of a positive for a lot of people, but I think that now that he’s President, people need to accept that and move forward because there’s nothing you can do about it now, and that really helped teach me to move forward and focus on the positive side of things.', '', 'K: Speaking of politics, what did you learn from last year, or even from recent events, what did you learn or feel politically about the whole election cycle?', '', 'M: Y’know, I’d include my last answer too, just learning to accept things, and also not to assume anything, because a lot of people assumed Clinton was going to win, and that came as a huge shocker to everybody. So you really just gotta do what you can and hope for the best and make due with what you have.', '', 'K: What are your views right now for the future? What are your views on what’s going on in the recent headlines and tweets, what goes through your mind when you’re reading those?', '', 'M: I just try to stay focused on what I believe to be true and not let all these contradictory statements get in the way of my personal beliefs, because it’s easy to be persuaded to go this way or that way, but I think it’s important to stay true to who you are and what you believe.', '', 'K: I agree. Is there anything from 2017, specifically? There’s only been two, three weeks, but have any events in the past new year really stuck out, or that you’ve been happy about, any that have evoked feelings?', '', 'M: You know, my life hasn’t been too eventful since 2017 started, so I don’t know if there’s much...obviously, there’s been a lot going on in the later part of 2016, so nothing specific. I’m just mainly trying to stay focused and hope that something good comes along that I can grab hold of and make the most of.', '', 'K: That’s good.', '', ""M: And also, college starting for me is a big thing. It's not a world event, but it’s personal for me, and I’m looking forward to that…"", '', 'K: Have you gone to any shows or concerts recently, or are you going to any in the near future?', '', 'M: I can’t remember the last time I was actually at a concert...I hope to go to one in the near future! Hopefully, one of the artists that I like will be performing near me, but I can’t even remember the last time. It definitely would be a nice experience, I would want to see Hopsin, that would be awesome. I’m sure he puts on a heck of a show.', '', 'K: Other than Hopsin, who else would you like to see? Obviously, [Hopsin and] Taylor Swift.', '', 'M: Yeah, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Eminem, maybe Lil’ Wayne, Tech N9ne...I just love rap.', '', 'K: Speaking of Lil’ Wayne, are you aware of his album situation and what’s going on with his music? What do you think about that?', '', 'M: Yeah, you mean how he’s going to put out his last album and then he’s retiring after Tha Carter V-', '', 'K: And that he’s having problems getting it released and all of that?', '', 'M: I think his label has been giving him a lot of crap trying to release that, and I think that’s affecting some of the music he puts out, and it can go either way: He can take that and use that as fuel, or he could let that stop him and get in his way of making great music, but I think he’s going to take that and go far with it and use that to make better music with Tha Carter V, because I want that to be a really good album, cause he said he’s going to retire after that.', '', 'K: And are there any albums or events that you’re looking forward to, any upcoming shows like the Super Bowl, maybe - something musically that you’re looking forward to? Albums...', '', 'M: Definitely the Super Bowl, I don’t know who’s going to perform at that yet, but I’m sure that’s decided -', '', 'K: Yeah, it’s Lady Gaga.', '', 'M: Lady Gaga? Oh, okay...alright, they could’ve done better but that’s alright. I love the Super Bowl halftime shows, though, I mean, they’re always fun no matter who performs, hopefully the Patriots will get in cause that’s my team right there.', '', 'K: Ahhh, okay, so you’re going for the Patriots…', '', 'M: Yeah, definitely. Who are you rooting for?', '', 'K: Y’know, it’s kinda weird - I [am] a Giants fan, and in a way, I wanted the Cowboys to go and win [this past weekend] just so they could get rid of Tony Romo, cause I hate Tony Romo. But of the 4 teams left, um...it would be nice for the Falcons to win. I used to live in Atlanta, and they’re a really good team - and it’s the last year in the [Georgia] Dome, so it would be really nice to see them win. Just so they could shut up about Aaron Rodgers, who is also overrated to me, but...I can’t see anybody stopping the Patriots [other than us], I just can’t...so maybe, it would be nice for the Falcons to win, but...I just can’t see anybody stopping the Patriots.', '', 'M: That was just a close game, the Cowboys game the other night. I don’t know if you saw it.', '', 'K: Yeah, that was a good one.', '', 'M: It was really intense. It was a good one.', '', 'K: It really was, it was like ‘...wow.’ And then they iced him! That ball looked like he was going to miss, too, when he kicked it.', '', 'M: Oh yeah, it was almost outside of the left, and then it looked like it just barely skimmed that.', '', 'K: Yeah, I was like, ‘Ugh, There it goes.’ But, they had a great season, Dak and Zeke, they all had a great season. But, speaking of sports, are there any sports things that you’re looking forward to, in terms of basketball and baseball or other sports…?', '', 'M: Well, for myself, I usually just follow the Patriots when they’re in the Super Bowl. That’s where my extent of sports goes to, but personally I like playing basketball, so I’m looking forward to hopefully playing in college this year for a community team.', '', 'K: Oh, cool. So what’s your team in the NBA?', '', 'M: The Celtics back in Massachusetts.', '', 'K: It’s been a little bit of a rocky season, but they’re not that bad.', '', 'M: Yeah, they’re alright.', '', 'K: I have a few of them on my fantasy team.', '', 'M: Who’s your fantasy team built up of?', '', 'K: I have a few, In terms of [from] the Celtics, I have Isiah Thomas on two of them, I also have Jae Crowder, and some other guys...Oh! Al Horford, is Al Horford a Celtic now?', '', 'M: Oh yeah.', '', 'K: Yeah, so, a couple of guys, I have Horford on a couple of teams. I like to spread it out so I don’t depend on one player for every team.', '', 'M: That’s cool though.', '', 'K: Imma throw in a shameless promotion here. Would you be interested in playing fantasy baseball, because I’m trying to start a fantasy baseball league when the time comes?', '', 'M: Yeah, man. I’ve never done that before, so I might take you up on that and see what it’s all about, but yeah, I’ll definitely keep that in mind.', '', 'K: Cool, I’m willing to teach and I actually have a few people interested, so, definitely, we can talk about that.', '', 'The last thing I want to touch on, is that you have a few poems called Enlightening Sessions with Madkol, “Pain for Glory,” and “Power”...I’m sure you have more poems, but why did you decide to [transcribe] these two and what made you write about these two...they deal with similar subjects, about false idolization and how we admire things, jump into things, falling in love without understanding them, like Facebook, and different subjects. Why did you write them, and where do you see them going? Is there any more Enlightening Sessions we have coming up?', '', 'M: Yeah, those ones I posted were actually the first two poems I had ever written, so I wanted to put them on there first. And you’ll definitely see more additions to that album I put on there. I really just like to write about intense, meaningful subjects, and a lot of the stuff I write is dark--like some of the songs I write--but I would say that those poems are really inspired by what you just said, about people who just focus on their outward appearance, and who has the most likes on Facebook, when there’s a lot more to life than that. I would sum it up like that.', '', 'K: Alright! Thank you, I encourage you to keep writing poetry. I love the poems, I read them both, so I encourage you to keep writing. Thank you for the interview.', '', 'M: Thank you for doing it, that was awesome.', '', 'K: You’re welcome, no problem. Is there anything else you would like to say to the great people of Genius?', '', 'M: Just keep fighting. Keep fighting the good fight. And keep annotating, getting rid of the red, and helping make Genius a better place, so do what you gotta do to do that, and be yourself.', '', 'K: Alright, thanks Madkol, have a goodnight.', '', 'M: Alright.', '', '--', '', 'Bonus:', '', 'K: Also, I forgot to ask, what is your tattoo of/represent?', '', 'M: Oh, it’s a cross. A symbol of my faith in God. Glad you asked me that one!', '', 'K: That’s awesome, are there any others?', '', 'M: No, just the one. Hopefully I’ll be able to afford another one in the near future. You have any?', '', 'K: I don’t have any. I have a hard enough time maintaining my ear piercings! I don’t really like needles or pain, and I haven’t really found anything yet that I think is worth getting on my body permanently.', '', 'M: It wasn’t really that painful, a lot of people think that but it was just kind of like somebody scratching you in the same spot over and over.9Embed']"
